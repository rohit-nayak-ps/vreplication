* Example commands for all with explanation


Next:

* Write VStream API internals (example will be the change data capture use case)

* Related schema tables

* Go through code for each command and document special cases, options

=== FUTURE

* tribal knowledge (actual use cases, #rows/TBs, #shards, time taken for workflow, vdiff, switchwrites downtimes)

* gotchas
